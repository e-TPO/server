# Goal
This project aims at developing an online application for the Training and 
Placement Department of the college. To train and place the students in 
colleges, TPO’s have to collect the information and CV’s and manages 
them manually and arranges them according to various streams.

Managing CV’s of 1000 students , sorting them according to their stream, credits etc. manually is not a good idea because human errors are not tolerable and every student has its own unique talent. Every year almost 1000 students sit in placement from undergraduate programs only so the application developed must be simple, easy to use, convenient, handy, scalable and efficient.

The solution proposed consists of a web application as well as an android application. The user will be identified by his/her MIS credentials. A student will be having options for uploading his/her resume. A company will be having its own profile. From company panel a company can update its requirements like minimum CPI required, minimum credits required etc. The request will be sent to the administrator and after approving the request the company would get the detailed information about a student.

From the admin panel we can send notifications to the students so that if a company is coming in the campus the student would be notified immediately. Following are some of the key features available in the application:

1. Compatibility: The android app can be easily used by the users having android version greater than or equivalent to 4.3 (Jelly Bean). And the web app will be responsive with a clean and simple UI.

2. Scalable: The app would be designed keeping in mind the scalability of the application.

3. Easy to Use: The administrator would be having a root privilege so that a company can be approved to be shown to the students, and notice generation student list generation, mailing students would be a few common task of the app.

4. Source of Information: The app will be connected to the MIS of the institute so that academic information of the student can be retrieved easily.

5. Push Notifications: The push notifications to the user would be send in the app as well as web application.

6. Recommendation: We can have a recommendation system for the users according to the interest and eligibility. Which would work on a simple machine learning algorithm.


# Expected Users
- TPO Incharge
- TPO members
- HOD
- Students
- Participating Companies

# Features
- Machine Learning recommendation model for the aspiring students and the companies.
Mostly based on **Collaborative Filtering and Natural Language Processing.**
- Hastle-free notices to the concerned students. TPO can approve notice requests from different companies.
- Notifies user about the on going placement sessions. No need to worry about the sudden changes, you'll be notified!s
- Find out similar companies and hence similar kind of students based on their career choices, experience and skills.

## Summary
Along with creating a platform for students we are also creating a **recomndation engine** which on the basis of profile of the student will recommend students. Basically the students can connect with each other on the basis of what there profile.

As the world is in our hand so the e-TPO would provide students as well as TPO much more flexibility. Data being available online which includes academic information as well as the informations entered by the user like previous work-experience, achievements etc. The application promotes Digital India campaign led by our Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi. Conclusively the web app as well as android app will lead to a flexible system for TPO.
